📊 Hierarchical Clustering on Engineering Colleges

This project applies Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering to analyze and group engineering colleges based on key performance factors such as:

Teaching Quality

Fees

Placements

Internship Opportunities

Infrastructure

🔍 Project Overview

The dataset is preprocessed by removing non-numerical and identifier columns. Using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, colleges are grouped into clusters based on similarity in their attributes.

After clustering:

Mean values of each feature are calculated for every cluster

Cluster size (frequency) is computed to understand distribution

📌 Key Insights

Each cluster represents a distinct profile of colleges

Helps in identifying:

High-performing colleges

Budget-friendly institutions

Colleges with strong infrastructure but weaker placements, etc.

Useful for students, educators, and policymakers for comparison and decision-making

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Output

The final output shows cluster-wise average scores and the number of colleges in each cluster, making interpretation simple and effective.
